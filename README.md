<h2 align="center"> About Me </h2>
<p align="left">    I'm a civil engineer transitioning to become a frontend developer. In the past 18 months, I've developed skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React through courses and documentation. I'm eager to start my career as a frontend developer and am currently seeking job or internship opportunities throughout Germany. While I currently live in the Hesse province, I'm open to relocating.</p>
